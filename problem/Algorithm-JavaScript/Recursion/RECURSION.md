What is Recursion?
> Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
> Recursion is when function calls itself

Why Recursion?
> A great technique to simplify your solution
> If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful.

// Anology:

// > Problem is to find how many students per class.
// > Question Asked to Principal -> Professor -> Teacher1, Teacher2 
// > Answer from Teacher1, Teacher2 -> Professor -> Principal. In Class1 100 students, Class2 100 students. So, Total no.of students are 200.

// A Few points about recursion
// Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - A condition to terminate the recursion. So, If not loop not end.
// Recursive might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.
